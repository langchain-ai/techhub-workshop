    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangGraph Primitives Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **StateGraph** - Custom state schema with domain-specific fields\n",
    "   - `messages`: Shared with supervisor subgraph\n",
    "   - `customer_id`: Verification status\n",
    "   - `verification_attempts`: Retry logic control\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nodes** - Modular functions that operate on state\n",
    "   - `query_router`: Combines routing logic (checks state + classifies)\n",
    "   - `verify_customer`: HITL with retry loop\n",
    "   - `supervisor`: Subgraph node (compiled graph from Section 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Command** - Combines state updates with routing decisions\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   return Command(\n",
    "       update={\"customer_id\": \"CUST-001\"},\n",
    "       goto=\"supervisor\"\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **interrupt()** - Pause execution for human input\n",
    "   - MUST come first in the node function\n",
    "   - Everything before it re-runs on resume\n",
    "   - Requires checkpointer to work\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Checkpointer** - State persistence across turns\n",
    "   - Required for `interrupt()` to work\n",
    "   - Enables conversation memory\n",
    "   - Automatically propagated to subgraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Subgraphs** - Compose graphs as nodes\n",
    "   - Reuse Section 3's supervisor as a node\n",
    "   - Shared state keys (`messages`)\n",
    "   - Clean separation of concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use What\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Use When... |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **`create_agent`** | Simple agents, standard tool loops, straightforward routing |\n",
    "| **LangGraph StateGraph** | Conditional HITL, custom state, complex orchestration, retry loops |\n",
    "| **Hybrid (this section!)** | Keep agents simple, add sophisticated orchestration layer |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retry Loop Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The `verify_customer` node demonstrates a powerful pattern:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def verify_customer(state):\n",
    "    attempts = state.get(\"verification_attempts\", 0)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if attempts >= 3:\n",
    "        return Command(update={...}, goto=END)  # Max attempts\n",
    "    \n",
    "    email = interrupt(...)  # Pause for input\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if not valid(email):\n",
    "        return Command(\n",
    "            update={\"verification_attempts\": attempts + 1},\n",
    "            goto=\"verify_customer\"  # RETRY: route back to self!\n",
    "        )\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Success\n",
    "    return Command(update={...}, goto=\"supervisor\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Separation of Concerns:**\n",
    "- Verification layer: Handles HITL and customer identity\n",
    "- Supervisor: Routes to appropriate specialists\n",
    "- Sub-agents: Execute specific tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Reusability:**\n",
    "- Section 3's supervisor works unchanged\n",
    "- Sub-agents remain simple with `create_agent`\n",
    "- Verification logic isolated in LangGraph layer\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Maintainability:**\n",
    "- Update verification rules without touching supervisor\n",
    "- Change max retry attempts in one place\n",
    "- Clear flow visible in graph structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Module 1 Complete! 🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "You've now built:\n",
    "1. **Section 1:** Manual tool calling (foundation)\n",
    "2. **Section 2:** `create_agent` abstraction (simplification)\n",
    "3. **Section 3:** Multi-agent with supervisor (specialization)\n",
    "4. **Section 4:** LangGraph primitives + HITL (sophistication) ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- **Module 2:** Evaluate this system to find weaknesses\n",
    "- **Module 3:** Deploy to production with LangGraph Cloud\n",
    "\n",
