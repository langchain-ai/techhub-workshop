    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangGraph Primitives Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **StateGraph** - Custom state schema with domain-specific fields\n",
    "   - `messages`: Shared with supervisor subgraph (uses `add_messages` reducer)\n",
    "   - `customer_id`: Verification status (set after successful email validation)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nodes** - Modular functions that operate on state\n",
    "   - `query_router`: Routes based on verification needs (checks state + classifies query)\n",
    "   - `verify_customer`: Extracts email using structured output & validates against database\n",
    "   - `collect_email`: Dedicated HITL node with `interrupt()`\n",
    "   - `supervisor_agent`: Subgraph node (compiled graph from Section 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Command for Explicit Routing** - Nodes control their own flow\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def verify_customer(state):\n",
    "       if success:\n",
    "           return Command(update={...}, goto=\"supervisor_agent\")\n",
    "       else:\n",
    "           return Command(update={...}, goto=\"collect_email\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   **Benefit:** Routing logic is co-located with business logic - easier to understand!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **interrupt()** - Pause execution for human input\n",
    "   - Best practice: Use dedicated node for `interrupt()`\n",
    "   - Separate HITL logic from business logic\n",
    "   - Requires checkpointer to work\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Checkpointer** - State persistence across turns\n",
    "   - Required for `interrupt()` to work\n",
    "   - Enables conversation memory\n",
    "   - Automatically propagated to subgraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Subgraphs** - Compose graphs as nodes\n",
    "   - Reuse Section 3's supervisor as a node\n",
    "   - Shared state keys (`messages`)\n",
    "   - Clean separation of concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use What\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Use When... |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **`create_agent`** | Simple agents, standard tool loops, straightforward routing |\n",
    "| **LangGraph StateGraph** | Conditional HITL, custom state, complex orchestration, retry loops |\n",
    "| **Hybrid (this section!)** | Keep agents simple, add sophisticated orchestration layer |\n"
