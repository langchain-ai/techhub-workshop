    "\n",
    "- Build specialized sub-agents with focused expertise\n",
    "- Understand the supervisor pattern for orchestration\n",
    "- Wrap sub-agents as tools for delegation\n",
    "- Test multi-agent coordination with LangSmith traces\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Sections 1-2, we built single agents that could use tools. But what if your system needs multiple types of expertise?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enter Multi-Agent Systems:**\n",
    "- **Specialized sub-agents** - Each agent is an expert in one domain\n",
    "- **Supervisor agent** - Routes queries to the right specialist\n",
    "- **Tool wrapping** - Sub-agents become tools for the supervisor\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have a complete customer support system with:\n",
    "- **Database Agent** - Expert at querying orders, products, customer data\n",
    "- **RAG Agent** - Expert at searching product docs and policies\n",
    "- **Supervisor** - Routes queries to the appropriate specialist(s)\n"

    "2. **Chunks become vectors (embeddings)** that capture meaning\n",

    "- **25 product docs + 5 policy docs** → **337 chunks**\n",
    "- **HuggingFace embeddings** (local, no API key needed)\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Built\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specialized Sub-Agents**\n",
    "   - Database Agent: Expert at structured data queries\n",
    "   - RAG Agent: Expert at document search\n",
    "   - Each agent has focused tools and expertise\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Supervisor Pattern**\n",
    "   - Sub-agents wrapped as tools (`@tool` decorator)\n",
    "   - Supervisor routes queries to appropriate specialist(s)\n",
    "   - Can orchestrate **parallel** or **sequential** coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Coordination Patterns**\n",
    "   - **Simple routing**: Single agent handles entire query\n",
    "   - **Parallel coordination**: Multiple agents work independently on different parts\n",
    "   - **Sequential coordination**: Output from one agent feeds into another (true orchestration!)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Benefits of Multi-Agent Architecture**\n",
    "   - **Separation of concerns** - Each agent has clear responsibility\n",
    "   - **Easier debugging** - Traces show which agent handled what\n",
    "   - **Maintainability** - Update one agent without affecting others\n",
    "   - **Scalability** - Easy to add new specialist agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Multi-Agent vs Single Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Single Agent when:**\n",
    "- Simple use case with 2-3 tools\n",
    "- All tools are similar in nature\n",
    "- No need for specialized expertise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Multi-Agent when:**\n",
    "- Multiple distinct domains (database, docs, APIs, etc.)\n",
    "- Different tools need different system prompts\n",
    "- Want separation of concerns for debugging\n",
    "- Need sequential coordination where output of one agent informs another\n",
    "- Building complex workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Viewing Traces in LangSmith\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to your LangSmith project to see:\n",
    "- **Routing decisions** - Which agent(s) the supervisor called\n",
    "- **Tool executions** - What tools each agent used\n",
    "- **Message flow** - Complete conversation tree\n",
    "- **Timing** - How long each step took\n",
    "- **Sequential dependencies** - See when agents must run in order\n",
    "\n",
    "This visibility makes multi-agent systems much easier to debug!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next: Section 4 (Advanced Track)\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Section 4**, we'll use **LangGraph primitives** to build even more sophisticated workflows:\n",
    "- Custom state management beyond messages\n",
    "- Conditional routing based on state\n",
    "- `interrupt()` for Human-in-the-Loop\n",
    "- Customer verification workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key decision point:**\n",
    "- Use `create_agent` for standard agent workflows ✅\n",
    "- Use LangGraph primitives for complex orchestration needs ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looking Ahead to Module 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how we're still limited by having only specific, pre-defined tools:\n",
    "- Can't answer: \"What products has customer CUST-001 bought?\" (need SQL JOINs)\n",
    "- Can't answer: \"Show me all orders over $500\" (need flexible queries)\n",
    "- Can't answer: \"Which customers bought MacBooks?\" (need complex SQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Module 2**, we'll upgrade the Database Agent to a **SQL Generation Agent** that can:\n",
    "- Generate dynamic SQL queries for ANY question\n",
    "- Handle complex JOINs and aggregations\n",
    "- Dramatically expand system capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "This sets up a clear pedagogical win: Module 1 teaches multi-agent patterns, Module 2 shows how to make agents more powerful! 🚀"
