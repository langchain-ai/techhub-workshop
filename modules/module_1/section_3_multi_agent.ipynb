    "\n",
    "The agents we built in this section (Database Agent, Documents Agent, and Supervisor) have been **refactored into the `agents/` directory** as reusable factory functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `agents/db_agent.py` - Database Agent factory\n",
    "- `agents/docs_agent.py` - Documents Agent factory\n",
    "- `agents/supervisor_agent.py` - Supervisor Agent factory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why factory functions?**\n",
    "- Fresh checkpointer for each instantiation (no state pollution)\n",
    "- Clean imports and reusability across notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Section 4**, we'll import these agents rather than redefining them:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from agents import create_db_agent, create_docs_agent, create_supervisor_agent\n",

    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What We Built\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specialized Sub-Agents**\n",
    "   - Database Agent: Expert at structured data queries\n",
    "   - Documents Agent: Expert at document search\n",
    "   - Each agent has focused tools and expertise\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Supervisor Pattern**\n",
    "   - Sub-agents wrapped as tools (`@tool` decorator)\n",
    "   - Supervisor routes queries to appropriate specialist(s)\n",
    "   - Can orchestrate **parallel** or **sequential** coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Coordination Patterns**\n",
    "   - **Simple routing**: Single agent handles entire query\n",
    "   - **Parallel coordination**: Multiple agents work independently on different parts\n",
    "   - **Sequential coordination**: Output from one agent feeds into another (true orchestration!)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Benefits of Multi-Agent Architecture**\n",
    "   - **Separation of concerns** - Each agent has clear responsibility\n",
    "   - **Easier debugging** - Traces show which agent handled what\n",
    "   - **Maintainability** - Update one agent without affecting others\n",
    "   - **Scalability** - Easy to add new specialist agents\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Viewing Traces in LangSmith\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to your LangSmith project to see:\n",
    "- **Routing decisions** - Which agent(s) the supervisor called\n",
    "- **Tool executions** - What tools each agent used\n",
    "- **Message flow** - Complete conversation tree\n",
    "- **Timing** - How long each step took\n",
    "- **Sequential dependencies** - See when agents must run in order\n",
    "\n",
    "This visibility makes multi-agent systems much easier to debug!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What's Next: Section 4\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Section 4**, we'll use **LangGraph primitives** to build even more sophisticated workflows:\n",
    "- Custom state management beyond messages\n",
    "- Conditional routing based on state\n",
    "- `interrupt()` for Human-in-the-Loop\n",
    "- Customer verification workflows\n",
