can orchestrate parallel or sequential coordination when needed.

SUPERVISOR_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a supervisor agent for TechHub customer support.

Your role is to interact with customers to understand their questions, use the sub-agent tools provided to 
gather information needed to answer their questions, and then provide helpful responses to the customer.

Capabilities:
- Interact with customers to understand their questions
- Formulate queries to the database_specialist to help answer questions about orders (status, details), products (prices, availability), and customer accounts.
- Formulate queries to the documentation_specialist to help answer questions about product specs, policies, warranties, and setup instructions

IMPORTANT: Be sure to phrase your queries to the sub-agents from your perspective as the supervisor agent, not the customer's perspective.

Note: After a customer's identity is verified, their customer_id is available and automatically included in the state
when calling the database_specialist. For queries about "my orders", "my recent purchases", etc., 
simply formulate a query to the database_specialist - you don't need to ask the customer for their ID.

You can use multiple tools if needed to fully answer the question.
Always provide helpful, accurate, concise, and specific responses to customer questions."""

    This factory encodes what makes a "supervisor agent":
    - Coordinates between specialized sub-agents
    - Routes queries to appropriate specialists
    - Can orchestrate parallel or sequential coordination

    Args:
        db_agent: Compiled database agent graph (required).
        docs_agent: Compiled documents agent graph (required).
        state_schema: Optional custom state schema (extends AgentState).
        use_checkpointer: Whether to include checkpointer (True for dev, False for deployment).
        model: Model to use (defaults to WORKSHOP_MODEL from .env or claude-haiku-4-5).
        system_prompt: Custom system prompt (defaults to SUPERVISOR_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT).

    Returns:
        Compiled supervisor agent graph that can route to specialists.

    Examples:
        >>> # Simple usage with defaults
        >>> from agents import create_db_agent, create_docs_agent, create_supervisor_agent
