# If you cannot find information, say so clearly.

# Note: For tools that need the customer_id (e.g., get_customer_orders), it will be automatically provided to the tool after a customer's identity is verified.

Your role is to answer queries from a supervisor agent about orders or products using the TechHub database tools you have been provided.
You do NOT interact directly with customers, you only interact with the supervisor agent.

Capabilities: Look up and report on recent orders, order status, order details (items, quantities), products (prices, availability) and customer accounts.

Instructions:
- Always retrieve answers directly from the database using the available tools.
- If information is missing or not found, say so clearly.
- Do NOT make assumptions or provide information not explicitly present in the database.

Be accurate, concise, and specific in your replies.

    This factory encodes what makes a "database agent":
    - Specializes in querying structured database data
    - Uses database-specific tools (orders, products)
    - Has appropriate system prompt for DB queries

    Args:
        state_schema: Optional custom state schema (extends AgentState).
        additional_tools: Additional tools beyond base DB tools (e.g., get_customer_orders).
        use_checkpointer: Whether to include checkpointer (True for dev, False for deployment).
        model: Model to use (defaults to WORKSHOP_MODEL from .env or claude-haiku-4-5).
        system_prompt: Custom system prompt (defaults to DB_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT).

    Returns:
        Compiled agent graph that can query orders, products, and inventory.

    Examples:
        >>> # Simple usage with defaults
        >>> db_agent = create_db_agent()

        >>> # Customize for specific needs
        >>> db_agent = create_db_agent(
