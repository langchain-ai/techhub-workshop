# TechHub E-Commerce Workshop Dataset

High-quality synthetic dataset for teaching LangGraph multi-agent systems in enterprise workshops.

## Overview

This dataset simulates a customer support system for "TechHub," a consumer electronics e-commerce store. It's designed to teach:
- Multi-agent systems with supervisor pattern
- Human-in-the-loop (HITL) for customer verification
- Database agent queries
- RAG agent for product specs and policies
- Offline evaluation (final response, trajectory, single-step, multi-turn)

## Quick Start - Using the Dataset

The dataset is ready to use! All files are in the `data/` directory.

### With Python

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to database
conn = sqlite3.connect('data/structured/techhub.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Find customer by email (HITL scenario)
cursor.execute(
    "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE email = ?",
    ('sarah.chen@gmail.com',)
)
customer = cursor.fetchone()

# Get customer's orders
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT order_id, order_date, status, total_amount
    FROM orders 
    WHERE customer_id = ?
    ORDER BY order_date DESC
""", (customer[0],))

for order in cursor.fetchall():
    print(order)

conn.close()
```

### With SQLite CLI

```bash
# Open database
sqlite3 data/structured/techhub.db

# Try sample queries
.read data_generation/sample_queries.sql

# Or explore interactively
SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 5;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE status = 'Shipped';
```

### With JSON Files

```python
import json

# Load data
with open('data/structured/customers.json') as f:
    customers = json.load(f)

with open('data/structured/orders.json') as f:
    orders = json.load(f)

# Find customer
customer = next(c for c in customers if c['email'] == 'sarah.chen@gmail.com')

# Get their orders
customer_orders = [o for o in orders if o['customer_id'] == customer['customer_id']]
print(f"{customer['name']} has {len(customer_orders)} orders")
```

## Workshop Scenarios

This dataset supports key LangGraph workshop scenarios:

### 1. Customer Verification (HITL)
```
User: "Show me my orders"
Flow: Supervisor → HITL (ask for email) → Database Agent → Response
```

### 2. Multi-Agent Coordination (DB + RAG)
```
User: "I ordered a MacBook last week, what ports does it have?"
Flow: Database Agent (find order) → RAG Agent (get specs) → Response
```

### 3. Complex Multi-Hop Query
```
User: "Can I return the monitor I bought and will it work with my Dell laptop?"
Flow: Database (find monitor) → RAG (return policy + compatibility) → Response
```

### 4. Order Tracking
```
User: "What's the status of order ORD-2024-0001?"
Flow: Database Agent → Response
```

### 5. Product Compatibility (Pure RAG)
```
User: "Do AirPods work with Windows laptops?"
Flow: RAG Agent (compatibility guide) → Response
```

### 6. Bundle Recommendations
```
User: "I'm buying a laptop, what else should I get?"
Flow: Database (bundle analysis) → RAG (product details) → Response
```

## Sample Queries

See `data_generation/sample_queries.sql` for complete workshop queries including:
- Customer verification
- Order status tracking
- Product bundle analysis
- Refund calculations

## Data Regeneration

**Don't need to regenerate?** Skip this section - the data is ready to use!

To regenerate the dataset from scratch (e.g., for different data, learning purposes):

```bash
cd data_generation
python generate_customers.py   # Requires: pip install faker
python generate_orders.py
python generate_order_items.py
python create_database.py
python validate_database.py
```

**See `data_generation/README.md` for complete regeneration guide.**

## Data Characteristics

### Realistic Patterns

- **Temporal:** Orders span 2 years with seasonal patterns (Q4 spike)
- **Behavioral:** Power law distribution (20% of customers = 60% of orders)
- **Product Affinity:** Laptops bought with accessories, monitors with keyboards
- **Pricing:** 80% at current price, 20% with ±5% historical variance
- **Geographic:** Customers distributed across US regions

### Data Quality

- ✅ Zero foreign key violations

- ✅ 100% order total accuracy
- ✅ Perfect segment distributions
- ✅ All queries <1ms (target: <100ms)
